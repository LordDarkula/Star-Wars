##Midichlorian_Predictor.py
Uses this [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Luke-Skywalkers-midichlorian-count-How-does-his-count-compare-to-other-Jedis)
data to predict how many midichlorians you would have if you knew how many your parents had or if you are in the Skywalker family.
```python
print clf.predict([[16000]])
```
Here replace 16000 with any midichlorian count you choose, or use a pre-existing midichlorian count of any Jedi in the program.
```python
print clf.predict([[kenobi]])
```
or
```python
print clf.predict([[luke]])
```
